        "**B. Answer:** The model in the first case is trained with 100 examples and with 200 examples in the second case. But the learning rate in the second is relatively low as compared to the first. The learning rate defines how the model should learn from the predicted errors during the updating of the weights. The first case has low training data but the learning rate is high. Hence it has higher accuracy. The second case has more training data but lower learning rate, hence the accuracy is low. \n",
        "\n",
        "**C. Answer:** I don't think the adding more hyperparameters would give us higher accuracy as the data is not linearly seperable, i.e., it cannot be seperated by a straight line on a graph. Hence, adding more hyperparameters would not help in increasing the accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**D. Answer:** I think it is worth training the model for more epochs while keeping other hyperparameters fixed to some extant. But it would not always help us. In the above example with 400 training samples, the accuracy was 69 for 5 epochs and it has increased to 80 by training for 20 epochs. But the accuracy remains to be 80 even after training for 100 epochs. "
